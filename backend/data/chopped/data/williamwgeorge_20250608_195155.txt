The United States, for national security reasons and for industrial competitiveness reasons, cannot afford to have Boeing disappear. It must find a way to solve its problems. There is no other alternative.
A new article from
Liz Fedor
does a terrific job of highlighting Boeing's challenges and what needs to be done for the company to move forward. Thank you, Liz, for featuring some of my thoughts in the new
Twin Cities Business
article.

THE DEATH OF ETHICAL
hashtag
#
LEADERSHIP
The spectacular destruction of the Trump-Musk alliance is tearing away the final veneer of dignity from American leadership, exposing a grotesque theater of pathological narcissism that threatens the very foundations of democratic governance. This is not merely a political feud—it is the public autopsy of moral leadership in the modern era.
The facts are revealing. Trump's aggressive trade tariffs triggered a dramatic market plunge, erasing nearly $150 billion in Tesla's valuation in a single day. Musk warned of economic recession. His scathing denunciation of Trump's "beautiful big bill" as a "disgusting abomination" further inflamed tensions. Trump's retaliatory threats to revoke government contracts from Musk's companies escalated the conflict into dangerous brinkmanship that risks disrupting national infrastructure, such as NASA's transport capabilities. The feud escalated further when Musk claimed Trump wouldn’t have won the election without him, and publicly alleged Trump's involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein files, calling for his impeachment, while Trump dismissed these claims accusing Musk of ingratitude.
This combustible spectacle exposes two men exhibiting textbook pathological narcissism: grandiosity masquerading as leadership, entitlement disguised as authority, and a complete absence of empathy for the millions whose livelihoods hang in the balance of their personal vendettas. Their public exchanges reveal classic narcissistic terror of humiliation—each perceiving the other as an existential threat to their fragile self-image, projecting internal insecurities through vindictive displays of aggression.
The ethical implications are devastating. Democratic ethics demands that public servants act from duty, guided by universalizable principles of justice. Yet both men have systematically exploited their positions for personal gain, violating the most basic fiduciary obligations to the public trust. Moreover, their policies and threats prioritize private vendettas over collective welfare with stunning disregard for consequences.
Historically, this trajectory is grimly familiar. From imperial hubris to modern autocracy, unchecked narcissism has precipitated wars, economic collapse, and systemic injustice. When pathological narcissism becomes tolerated—or worse, celebrated—it corrodes democratic norms and obliterates civic trust. This public humiliation ritual fosters cynicism and diminished expectations of integrity from those who govern, imperiling the social contract itself.
The Trump-Musk debacle serves as an urgent warning to Europe and the rest of the world. Ethical leadership isn't merely preferable—it's existential. Either we demand leaders who embody compassion, justice, temperance, and responsibility—virtues antithetical to narcissistic excess—or we surrender democracy to the whims of damaged egos. Without such leadership, we face not just bad governance, but the death of governance itself.

It's nearly four months since I published a post outlining many political outcomes that I thought might happen. Sadly, much of what was predicted has come to pass. One prediction covered the real objectives underlying the budget reconciliation bill, and another the relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk.
In the post that follows, I'll cover both. However, concerning the latter, I know that many of you would say it is inevitable when two powerful, volatile, and egotistical personalities accustomed to getting their way clash and vie for attention, it's just a matter of time until that conflict escalates and becomes public. Well, this is what we see happening today as the previous Trump-Musk partnership disintegrates before our very eyes—and the eyes of the world.
Do you think this was inevitable? And where do you think this will all end? Whatever the outcome, let's hope that these media sideshows subside so that real, substantive issues affecting everyday people in the U.S. and around the world can be addressed responsibly.
Was This Inevitable?

I had an opportunity to hear Bill at one of the conventions at Omaha wherein he explained what is the meaning of True Leadership. Till this date, that has been the best ever explanation I have come across on what happens with true leaders and what makes them a Leader.
Bill's book, True North is a real mind opener and gives you insights on what it takes you to be a leader.It has an impact on me and I can recommed the same to others who are looking for a fruitful change.
Looking forward to more such great books from you Bill.
